       <span class="bio-full" style="display: none;">I was born in Santiago de Chile on a warmish Autumn day in the mid-80s. I decided to course the Physics program at Universidad Catolica de Chile (a.k.a, PUC), from which I obtained my B.Sc and M.Sc degree in Physics under the supervision of Prof. Miguel Orszag. My research, back then, was focused on Quantum Optics and Quantum Information in cQED. In 2011, I was awarded a 4-year scholarship from the Chilean government (Conicyt) to course a Ph.D. degree at University College London (a.k.a UCL), this time under Prof. Sougato Bose’s supervision. During this time, I not only enjoyed the friendly British pubs, or the more-than-occasionally afternoon football with friends, but also I investigated on cavity quantum optomechanics and hybrid spin-optomechanical systems. After my Ph.D. degree, I returned to PUC to work as the principal investigator with Prof. Orszag, thanks to a 3-year postdoctoral grant funded by the Chilean government (Fondecyt). Currently, I’m part of Prof. Abolfazl’s group in Chengdu under the Talent Introduction Program, where I’ve focused my research on quantum metrology.

       <span class="bio-full" style="display: none;">Dr. Ilaria Siloi is a Computational Physicist with over six years of experience as a research scholar. She began her academic journey with a Ph.D., where she specialized in quantum information and developed expertise in modeling and detecting quantum correlations within realistic spin systems, particularly focusing on molecular nanomagnets. Following her doctoral studies, she worked as a postdoctoral associate in Italy and Finland for two years, concentrating on the decoherent dynamics of few-particle quantum walks.
Her growing interest in solid-state physics and material science led her to the University of North Texas, where she delved into ab initio methodologies. During her time there, her research was centered on solving electronic structure problems and designing novel thermoelectric materials. Recently, driven by her enthusiasm for quantum technologies and a curiosity for solving real-world challenges using quantum computing, she joined the University of Southern California. At USC, she now applies quantum annealers and gate-based quantum computers to address complex problems in quantum chemistry and materials science.

       <span class="bio-full" style="display: none;">Prof. Sami Muhaidat is currently  Professor and the Deputy Director of the 6G Research Center at Khalifa University.  Before joining Khalifa University, he was an Assistant Professor in the School of Engineering Science at Simon Fraser University, BC, from 2008-2012. He was also an NSERC postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto from 2007-2008. He is a Professional Engineer registered in the province of British Columbia and an Adjunct Professor at Carleton University, Canada. Sami's research interests focus on the following areas: 1) IoT with emphasis on battery-free (energy-constrained) devices, 2) communication theory (physical layer security, 6G enabling technologies, and optical wireless communications), and 3) machine learning and their applications in the fields of wireless networks and security. He made contributions in the areas of low-power IoT networks, machine learning for wireless communications, physical layer security, cognitive radio networks, MIMO, cooperative communication networks, optical communications, wireless power transfer, hardware impairments, and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for future wireless networks.  He has published/submitted over 350 peer-reviewed technical papers/book chapters in these areas. Sami was invited to give seminars/presentations at several international conferences/workshops and has received over USD 5M in internal and external funding. During his career, he supervised/co-supervised over 40 graduate students/visitors and postdocs, including 16 Ph.D. students and 12 postdocs. He has a significant record of institutional and professional service, which has been recognized by his peers. His record includes high-profile editorial positions in prestigious IEEE journals: IEEE Transactions on Communications (Area Editor and Editor), IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society (Lead Guest Editor), IEEE Communications Letter (Senior Editor and Editor), and IEEE Transaction Vehicular Technology (Associate Editor). In addition, he received the top Associate Editor award for outstanding contributions to IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology. He served as the Chair of IEEE UAE SPC Chapter from 2017-2018. Sami was the recipient of several scholarships during his undergraduate and graduate studies and a winner of the 2006 NSERC Postdoctoral Fellowship competition.
