            <p> <span class="bio-short"></span>
       <span class="bio-full" style="display: none;">I was born in Santiago de Chile on a warmish Autumn day in the mid-80s. I decided to course the Physics program at Universidad Catolica de Chile (a.k.a, PUC), from which I obtained my B.Sc and M.Sc degree in Physics under the supervision of Prof. Miguel Orszag. My research, back then, was focused on Quantum Optics and Quantum Information in cQED. In 2011, I was awarded a 4-year scholarship from the Chilean government (Conicyt) to course a Ph.D. degree at University College London (a.k.a UCL), this time under Prof. Sougato Bose’s supervision. During this time, I not only enjoyed the friendly British pubs, or the more-than-occasionally afternoon football with friends, but also I investigated on cavity quantum optomechanics and hybrid spin-optomechanical systems. After my Ph.D. degree, I returned to PUC to work as the principal investigator with Prof. Orszag, thanks to a 3-year postdoctoral grant funded by the Chilean government (Fondecyt). Currently, I’m part of Prof. Abolfazl’s group in Chengdu under the Talent Introduction Program, where I’ve focused my research on quantum metrology.

            <p><span class="bio-short"></span>
       <span class="bio-full" style="display: none;">Matteo G. A. Paris is a prominent physicist and full professor at the University of Milano (Università degli Studi di Milano) in Italy. He specializes in quantum information and quantum optics within the university's department of physics, where he founded and lead the Pure and Applied Quantum Mechanics research group (http://sites.unimi.it/aqm), composed by about fifteen persons. His academic focus lies in theoretical physics, particularly in the area of matter models, mathematical methods, and applications. Professor Paris completed his Ph.D. in physics at the University of Pavia, and then was a post-doc in the group "Nichtklassiche Strahlung" of the Max-Planck-Society (Berlin). Before joining UniMi in 2004, he was research fellow of the University of Pavia and research associate of the National Institute for the Physics of Matter (INFM). He is a theoretician working in close collaborations with experimentalists on quantum information & technology, quantum optics, open quantum systems and foundations of quantum mechanics. In these fields he is author of 350+ publications on international journals, which received 21000+ citations, with about 70 invited talks and seminars; his H-index is currently 71 (Google schoolar). His main contributions are in the fields of quantum estimation of states and operations, generation and application of quantum correlations, quantum information processing, quantum walks and algorithms, open quantum systems, quantum metrology and high-precision measurements. In the recent years, he is mostly working in quantum sensing and metrology, continuous variable quantum technology, and quantum walks. He is also active in seeking for novel degrees of freedom for quantum technology, and to improve metrological protocols in the search of new physics.</span>

       <span class="bio-full" style="display: none;">Dr. Ilaria Siloi is a Computational Physicist with over six years of experience as a research scholar. She began her academic journey with a Ph.D., where she specialized in quantum information and developed expertise in modeling and detecting quantum correlations within realistic spin systems, particularly focusing on molecular nanomagnets. Following her doctoral studies, she worked as a postdoctoral associate in Italy and Finland for two years, concentrating on the decoherent dynamics of few-particle quantum walks.
Her growing interest in solid-state physics and material science led her to the University of North Texas, where she delved into ab initio methodologies. During her time there, her research was centered on solving electronic structure problems and designing novel thermoelectric materials. Recently, driven by her enthusiasm for quantum technologies and a curiosity for solving real-world challenges using quantum computing, she joined the University of Southern California. At USC, she now applies quantum annealers and gate-based quantum computers to address complex problems in quantum chemistry and materials science.
